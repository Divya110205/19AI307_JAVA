# Ex.No:11(A)         JAVA TREESET
## AIM:
 To develop a Java program to iterate through all elements in a tree set.


## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start
2.	Import `java.util.*`
3.	Define class `Main` with `main` method:
-	a) Initialize `Scanner` and read integer `n`
-	b) Create a `TreeSet` named `set` to store integers in sorted order
4.	Use a loop to read `n` integers and add each to `set`
5.	Use an enhanced `for` loop to print each element in `set`
6.	End
